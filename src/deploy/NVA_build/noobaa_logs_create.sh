help_message="Usage: $0 <log_bucket_range>
This script can be used to test log parsing. It takes number of buckets,
which you want to have logs from. Logs will be sent to /var/log/bucket_logs.log,
which is actually the path where rsyslogd will save the logs. Log buckets will be
having name like log.bucket-1, log.bucket-2, etc. So, to test if the BG worker is
uploading the logs correctly, you need to create buckets with similar names.
Example: $0 10"
